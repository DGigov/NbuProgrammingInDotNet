Problem 1.	Exchange If Greater
Write an if-statement that takes two integer variables a and b and exchanges their values if the first one 
is greater than the second one. As a result print the values a and b, separated by a space. 

Examples:
a	    b	    result
5	    2	    2 5
3	    4	    3 4
5.5	    4.5	    4.5 5.5

Problem 2.	Bonus Score
Write a program that applies bonus score to given score in the range [1…9] by the following rules:
•	If the score is between 1 and 3, the program multiplies it by 10.
•	If the score is between 4 and 6, the program multiplies it by 100.
•	If the score is between 7 and 9, the program multiplies it by 1000.
•	If the score is 0 or more than 9, the program prints “invalid score”.

Examples:
score	result
2	    20
4	    400
9	    9000
-1	    invalid score
10	    invalid score

Problem 3.	Check for a Play Card
Classical play cards use the following signs to designate the card face: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K and A. 
Write a program that enters a string and prints “yes” if it is a valid card sign or “no” otherwise. 

Examples:
character	Valid card sign?
5	        yes
1	        no
Q	        yes
q	        no
P	        no
10	        yes
500	        no

Problem 4.	Multiplication Sign
Write a program that shows the sign (+, - or 0) of the product of three real numbers, without calculating it. 
Use a sequence of if operators. 

Examples:
a	    b	    c	    result
5	    2	    2	    +
-2	    -2	    1	    +
-2	    4	    3	    -
0	    -2.5	4	    0
-1	    -0.5	-5.1	-
