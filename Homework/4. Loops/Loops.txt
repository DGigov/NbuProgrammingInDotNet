Problem 1

Write a program that enters from the console a positive integer n and prints all the numbers from 1 to n, on a single 
line, separated by a space

Problem 2

Write a program that enters from the console a positive integer n and prints all the numbers from 1 to n not divisible
by 3 and 7, on a single line, separated by a space. 

Problem 3

Write a program that reads from the console a sequence of n integer numbers and returns the minimal, the maximal 
number, the sum and the average of all numbers (displayed with 2 digits after the decimal point). The input starts by 
the number n (alone in a line) followed by n lines, each holding an integer number. 

Problem 4

Write a program that calculates n! / k! for given n and k (1 < k < n < 100). Use only one loop

Problem 5

Write a program that reads from the console a positive integer number n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) and prints a matrix like in the 
examples below. Use two nested loops. 

Examples:

n	matrix
2	1 2
    2 3

n	matrix
3	1 2 3
    2 3 4
    3 4 5

n	matrix
4	1 2 3 4
    2 3 4 5
    3 4 5 6
    4 5 6 7
