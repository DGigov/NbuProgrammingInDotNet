# ASP.NET MVC Project

Create a web application using ASP.NET MVC 5 and Entity Framework 6. The bussiness domain and purpose are up to you. You can implement any application according to the folowing requirments

1. Use ASP.NET MVC 5 and Entity Framework 6 (you can use ASP.NET CORE MVC and Entity Framework 7, but it is out of the scope of this course, so you will be on your own... with a little help from me and Google)

2. Use ASP.NET Identity to implement user management. You must implement:
    - user registration
    - user registration with 3-rd party provider (Facebook, Google or Microsoft. One of them is enough)
    - extended user profile (store additional information about user - photo, mobile phone, position or          something else that your application needs)
    - user login
    - user logout
    - forgotten password

3. Use Database to store your data
    - Use Code First approach
    - Use all CRUD operations on a Database (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
    - Use LINQ to Entities for your DB operations

4. Create minimum two bussiness domain controllers (AccounController and ManageController are not bussiness domain controllers) with several actions each

5. Use Action Filter and Custom Databinding if applicable

6. Use caching where appropriate

7. Consider security
    - Use client and server side data validation
    - Use ASP.NET MVC tools for preventing Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

8. User interface is out of the scope of current course and won't be taken into account, but you have to create the minimum required interface for the operation of your application.
